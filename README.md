# AI Image Forgery Detection Tool (ELA + ResNet50)

This project detects manipulated or AI-generated images using **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet50)**. It includes a **Streamlit web app** that allows users to upload images and instantly check if they are real or fake.

##  What is ELA?

**Error Level Analysis (ELA)** reveals tampered regions in an image by detecting differences in JPEG compression. Real images have uniform error levels. Manipulated parts stand out due to inconsistent compression artifacts.

---

##  Features

- Upload `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` images
- ELA preprocessing for manipulation detection
- ResNet50-based deep learning model
- Real-time prediction with confidence score
- Streamlit-powered web app

---

## How It Works

1. **User Uploads an Image**
2. **ELA Preprocessing** (via `resize_ela.py`)
3. **Model Prediction** (via trained `ela_model.h5`)
4. **Output**: Real or Fake + Confidence %

##  How It Works

1. **ELA Conversion**  
   `resize_ela.py` simulates JPEG compression, finds the difference (error), and enhances contrast.

2. **Model Training**  
   `train_model.py` loads all ELA images, labels them based on filenames (`real` or `fake`), and trains a CNN using ResNet50.

3. **Prediction App**  
   `app.py` takes user-uploaded images, ELA-processes them, and makes predictions via the trained model.
